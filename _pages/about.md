I am a 2nd-year **PhD student** at [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) at [MIT](https://mit.edu/) working with [Tommi Jaakkola](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ao4gtsYAAAAJ&hl=en). I work on machine learning algorithms, in particular generative modeling, as well connections to mathematics and science ("AI for science").  During my PhD, I also interned at [MetaAI](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-fair-research-new-releases/) working with [Yaron Lipman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vyteiT4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Ricky Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7MxQd6UAAAAJ&hl=en).

In the past, I earned an **MSc in Statistics** and an **MSc in Neuroscience** at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) supported by a [Rhodes Scholarship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_Scholarship) where I worked with [Yee Whye Teh](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/) on geometric deep learning and with [Stephen Smith](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gRptb5UAAAAJ&hl=en) on transfer learning for neuroimaging. I graduated with a **BSc in Mathematics** from the wonderful [University of Bonn](https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de/) where I worked with [Andreas Eberle](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=5sfw6SkAAAAJ&hl=de) on stochastic differential equations.

Before MIT, I worked at the AI-drug discovery company [Cellarity](https://cellarity.com/) as a Machine Learning Scientist. In the past, I also interned at [BCG Gamma](https://www.bcg.com/), [Genomics plc](https://www.genomicsplc.com/), the [Max Planck Institute](https://www.mpg.de/en), and the [German Parliament](https://www.bundestag.de/en). Besides my work, I have a passion for writing music, swimming, and hiking.
