I am a first-year PhD student at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ([CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/)). I am excited about developing machine learning methods that extends human knowledge ("AI for science").

Before MIT, I worked at the AI-drug discovery company [Cellarity](https://cellarity.com/) as a Machine Learning Scientist. I obtained a two master's degrees in Statistics and Neuroscience at the University of Oxford as part of the [Rhodes Scholarship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_Scholarship) where I worked with [Yee Whye Teh]() on geometric deep learning.


I also interned at [BCG Gamma](https://www.bcg.com/), [Genomics plc](https://www.genomicsplc.com/), the [Max Planck Institute](https://www.mpg.de/en), and the [German Parliament](https://www.bundestag.de/en).
